				Downloading videos has never been and will never be a feature of Vanced. It led to the shutdown of many Youtube Mods in the past.
				[In some regions](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6141269?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en) however, downloading is free.

				For downloading, use a third party tool like [Ymusic](https://ymusic.io).`
